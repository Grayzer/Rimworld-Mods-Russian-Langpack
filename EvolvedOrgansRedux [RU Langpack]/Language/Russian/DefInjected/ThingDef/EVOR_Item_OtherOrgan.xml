  <EVOR_Item_Eye.description>By integrating cells that allow for collection of light in the ultraviolent and infrared spectrum, these eyes allow for much more spacial awareness for their host.</EVOR_Item_Eye.description>

  <EVOR_Item_Nose.label>micro-analyzer nose</EVOR_Item_Nose.label>
  <EVOR_Item_Nose.description>Increasing the amount of cells deticated to analyzing specific important molecules, specific scents can be more easily parsed from a blowing wind.</EVOR_Item_Nose.description>

  <EVOR_Item_Spine.label>neuro-accelerated spine</EVOR_Item_Spine.label>
  <EVOR_Item_Spine.description>While the gila coating increases signal transmission speeds by an order of magnitude, more significant is the secondary processing nodules, which allow the spinal cord to process lower urgency signals on its own, lowering the load on the brain.</EVOR_Item_Spine.description>
